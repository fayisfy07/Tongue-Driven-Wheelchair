Developed a Tongue-Driven Wheelchair prototype incorporating a Hall sensor-based control system. This innovative solution allows individuals with severe physical disabilities to maneuver the wheelchair wirelessly using tongue movements. The system utilizes Hall sensors to detect tongue gestures, transmitting corresponding signals wirelessly to a microcontroller programmed in C++ via Arduino IDE. The wheelchair's movement is then controlled based on the received signals, enabling users to navigate with ease and independence.
